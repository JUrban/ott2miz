3~;; ott2miz - otter to Mizar translator
;; $Revision: 1.18 $
;; run with: emacs -batch -q -l ott2miz.el --eval '(translate-many "<indexfile>")'
;; where <indexfile> is in a directory with all problems (proof objects),
;; and it contains listing of their filenames (without directory)
;; results in .miz and .voc file for each problem.
;; Special mappings to Mizar symbols can be given for each file
;; in a rule file with extension .rul .
;; The rules must have the form:
;;
;; ("OTTER-SYMBOL" MIZAR-PATTERN)
;;
;; where MIZAR-PATTERN looks e.g. like (1 "=" 2),
;; i.e. the arguments are given by numbers, and the rest are supposed
;; to be Mizar symbols and interpunction.
;; Actually, this can
;; be used to expand to complex terms too, e.g. to
;; ("+(" 1 "," "-(" 2 "))" )

;; Note that symbols captured by these rules will not
;; be defined in the vocabulary and introduced via contradiction,
;; you will have to write the environmental directives manually for them.

;; We now use global hashes for symbols -
;; requires Emacs v. >= 21
